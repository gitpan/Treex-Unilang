=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::W2A::ResegmentSentences

=head1 VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If the sentence segmenter says that the current sentence is
actually composed of two or more sentences, then new bundles
are inserted after the current bundle, each containing just
one piece of the resegmented original sentence.

All zones are processed.
The number of bundles created is determined by the number of subsegments
in the "current" zone (specified by the parameters C<language> and C<selector>).
If a zone contains less subsegments than the current one,
the remaining bundles will contain empty sentence.
If a zone contains more subsegments than the current one,
the remaining subsegments will be joined in the last bundle.

In other words, it is granted that the current zone,
will not contain empty sentences.
