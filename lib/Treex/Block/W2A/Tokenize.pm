=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::W2A::Tokenize - language independent rule based tokenizer

=head1 VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each sentence is split into a sequence of tokens using a series of regexs.
Flat a-tree is built and attributes C<no_space_after> are filled.
This class uses language-independent regex rules for tokenization,
but it can be used as an ancestor for language-specific tokenization
by overriding the method C<tokenize_sentence>
or by using C<around> (see L<Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers>).
