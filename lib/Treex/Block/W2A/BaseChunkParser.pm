=head1 NAME 

Treex::Block::W2A::BaseChunkParser

=head1 VERSION

version 0.13095

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class serves as a base class for dependency parsers
that just need to override the C<parse_chunk> method.

The goal of segmenting a sentence into chunks is to guarantee that each chunk
will be parsed into its own subtree.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 
   
=item reparse

Process only bundles where the root node has the attribute C<reparse> set.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item label_parenthesis_token

Set the edge label of a parenthesis (round bracket) token.
This implementation sets C<conll_deprel> attribute to I<P>
and C<afun> to I<AuxG>,
but the method can be overriden if needed to set.
