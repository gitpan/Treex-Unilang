=head1 NAME

Treex::Tool::Segment::RuleBased - Rule based pseudo language-independent sentence segmenter

=head1 VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sentence boundaries are detected based on a regex rules
that detect end-sentence punctuation ([.?!]) followed by a uppercase letter.
This class is implemented in a pseudo language-independent way,
but it can be used as an ancestor for language-specific segmentation
by overriding the method C<segment_text>
(using C<around> see L<Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers>)
or just by overriding methods C<unbreakers>, C<openings> and C<closings>.

See L<Treex::Block::W2A::EN::Segment>

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item get_segments

Returns list of sentences

=back

=head1 METHODS TO OVERRIDE

=over 4

=item segment_text

Do the segmentation (handling C<use_paragraphs> and C<use_lines>)

=item $text = split_at_terminal_punctuation($text)

Adds newlines after terminal punctuation followed by an uppercase letter. 

=item unbreakers

Returns regex that should match tokens that usually do not end a sentence even if they are followed by a period and a capital letter:
* single uppercase letters serve usually as first name initials
* in langauge-specific descendants consider adding
  * period-ending items that never indicate sentence breaks
  * titles before names of persons etc.

=item openings

Returns string with characters that can appear before the first word of a sentence

=item closings

Returns string with characters that can appear after period (or other end-sentence symbol)
